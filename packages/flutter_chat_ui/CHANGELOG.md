## 2.2.0

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- **`ChatAnimatedList` Redesign**:
    - Significantly overhauled for robust handling of asynchronous controller updates.
    - The `update` operation (`ChatOperation.update`) now requires the `index` of the message to be updated.
- **CRITICAL**: When implementing custom `ChatController`s, you **MUST** now fetch the most up-to-date message instance from your data source *before* passing it to `remove` or `update` operations. The internal list now relies on the exact object reference. Failing to do so will lead to errors or unexpected behavior. (See `InMemoryChatController` for an example of fetching the actual message before emitting `ChatOperation.remove` or `ChatOperation.update`).

**‚ú® Key Enhancements & Fixes ‚ú®**

- **Asynchronous Operations**: `ChatAnimatedList` now uses an internal operation queue to serialize updates, preventing race conditions and resolving prior `StreamOperation` issues.
- **List Factorization**: Common logic between normal and reversed `ChatAnimatedList` instances has been factorized, improving maintainability.
- **Bulk Insertions**: Added `insertAllMessages` to `ChatController` and `ChatAnimatedList` for efficient bulk message additions with animations.
- **Diffing & Stability**: `ChatController`'s `setMessages` now uses an improved `DiffUtil` (with move support), fixing "out of bounds" errors during complex list updates.
- **Data Consistency**: The controller now fetches the latest message version before updates or deletions to ensure operations use current data.
- **Bug Fixes**:
    - Corrected message insertion position in reversed lists ([#754](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/754), [#755](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/755)).
    - Ensured message update operations are correctly persisted ([#778](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/778)).
- **Testing**: Introduced integration tests for `ChatAnimatedList` to validate list operations and item positioning.

---

 - **FIX**: update operation not persisted in the list ([#778](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/778)). ([37472015](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/commit/374720152912648643c03f761b0a27eafcf0a46f))
 - **FEAT**: Fix StreamOperation Async issues / create insertAll / fixInsert on reverted list ([#756](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/issues/756)). ([60395f9b](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/commit/60395f9ba97ac4b8000aea70c7040d55bb40b6aa))

## 2.1.0

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Chat controller methods have been renamed to avoid name conflicts with Riverpod.

- `insert` -> `insertMessage`
- `update` -> `updateMessage`
- `remove` -> `removeMessage`
- `set` -> `setMessages`

 - **FEAT**: rename chat controller methods. ([dc1bf57d](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/commit/dc1bf57d9b5f9655805589fdda5581759b9cc1a9))

## 2.0.1

 - **FIX**: document public APIs.

## 2.0.0

- Version 2.0.0 is a major update where we completely rebuilt the library. This version focuses on better performance, more customization options, and improved stability. We have added many new features and improvements to make your experience better. For more details, check out our blog post: https://flyer.chat/blog/v2-announcement/ üöÄ

## 2.0.0-dev.11

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Enhanced pagination functionality for the `ChatAnimatedList` widget. If you utilize the `paginationThreshold` parameter, please refer to the comments in the `ChatAnimatedList` widget implementation for detailed guidance.
- Updated the `Message` model to rename `parentId` to `replyToMessageId`
- The `createdAt` field is now optional in the message model
- The `sending` field has been removed from the message model; instead, you can set `sending: true` in the metadata of the Message model to achieve the same functionality.
- The `isOnlyEmoji` property has been removed from the text message model; to indicate that a message contains only emojis, use `isOnlyEmoji: true` in the metadata of the text message.
- The `firstName` and `lastName` fields in the `User` model have been consolidated into a single `name` field for improved simplicity.
- The default sentinel values that previously allowed users to set specific properties to `null` have been removed. Instead, please use `Colors.transparent`, `BorderRadius.zero`, or `TextStyle()` to achieve the desired effect. Passing `null` will now use the standard configuration.

**‚ö†Ô∏è New Features ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Added a `headerWidget` to the `ChatMessage` widget, enabling the display of a custom header for each message. You have the flexibility to control the header's position; wrap it with a `Center` widget for centering.
- Introduced new parameters: `sentMessageColumnAlignment`, `receivedMessageColumnAlignment`, `sentMessageRowAlignment`, and `receivedMessageRowAlignment` for the `ChatMessage` widget. These allow for precise control over the positioning of `leadingWidget`, `trailingWidget`, `topWidget`, and `bottomWidget`. Ensure correct defaults are set for proper alignment, especially when using the `topWidget`.
- Introduced `TextStreamMessage` type to support text streaming
- Added `textStreamMessageBuilder` to the `Builders` class to support text streaming UI widget

**Other changes**

- Introduced `MessageID` and `UserID` typedefs to provide clearer context, while maintaining their underlying type as `String`s

- Rename `inputBuilder` to `composerBuilder`

## 2.0.0-dev.9

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Requires Freezed 3.0.0
- Replace `status` field with a computed getter that determines message state based on lifecycle timestamps (`createdAt`, `deletedAt`, `sending`, `failedAt`, `sentAt`, `deliveredAt`, `seenAt`, `updatedAt`). This enables granular message history tracking and status transitions, matching the behavior of popular chat applications.
- Rename `overlay` to `hasOverlay` in `ImageMessage`

**Other changes**

- Downgrade `intl` package version for better compatibility with other Flutter packages
- Added `FileMessage` support to the example project
- Migrated web storage implementation from `indexed_db` to `idb_shim` for improved cross-platform compatibility and better performance

## 2.0.0-dev.8

- Changed default behavior of Enter key in `ChatInput` to create a newline instead of sending message
  - To send message on Enter, set `textInputAction: TextInputAction.send` when configuring `ChatInput` through builders
  - See `local.dart` example for how to use builders to customize input behavior

**‚ö†Ô∏è New features ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Add `ScrollToMessageMixin` to enable programmatic scrolling in chat list:
  - `scrollToMessage(messageId)`: Scrolls to a specific message by ID
  - `scrollToIndex(index)`: Scrolls to a message at a specific index
  - Both methods support customizable animation duration, curve, alignment and offset
  - Can be used directly through any `ChatController` instance
  - See the pagination example in the example project for usage details
- Add validation to prevent duplicate message IDs
- Added support for sending messages using Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut in ChatInput

**üêõ Bug Fixes**

- Fixed flickering in avatar widget by implementing a user cache with LRU eviction strategy, allowing synchronous access to recently resolved user data

## 2.0.0-dev.6

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Require Flutter 3.29 and Dart 3.7

**üêõ Bug Fixes**

- Temporarily disabled blur effect for chat input due to a crash in Flutter 3.29 (will be re-enabled once fix is available in stable)

**‚ö†Ô∏è New features ‚ö†Ô∏è**

- Add `hintText` to the `ChatInput` widget.
- Added avatar support. Check local example for details.
- `chatMessageBuilder` now returns `isRemoved` and `groupStatus` parameters. Group status returns information about message's position in the group. `isRemoved` is `true` if message is removed.
- Added `leadingWidget` and `trailingWidget` to the `ChatMessage` widget.

## 2.0.0-dev.4

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes ‚ö†Ô∏è**

üë• User Management:
- Replaced `user` parameter with `currentUserId` (String) and `resolveUser` function
- Users are now referenced by ID, with async user data resolution through `resolveUser`

‚öôÔ∏è API Changes:
- Renamed `ChatInputHeightNotifier.updateHeight()` to `setHeight()`
- Scroll controller management moved to individual list widgets that you can render via `builders`: `chatAnimatedListBuilder: ... return ChatAnimatedList(scrollController: _scrollController)`
- Text editing controller now configured through `ChatInput` widget

üîÑ Core Changes:
- `author` (type `User`) is replaced with `authorId` (type `String`) for simpler user management
- All `DateTime` properties now use milliseconds instead of microseconds for JSON serialization

üé® Theme Simplification:
Theme has been streamlined to 3 key parameters:
1. `colors` - Uses Material 3 semantic names (e.g. `primary`, `onPrimary`, `secondary`) making it easy to apply color schemes
2. `typography` - Follows Flutter's `TextTheme` semantic naming conventions
3. `shape` - Controls border radius of all messages (rounded vs square messages)

‚ú® New Features:

üë®‚Äçüíª Chat Experience:
- Added typing indicator support
- Background image customization
- Improved scroll-to-bottom performance

üìú List Behavior Controls:
- `shouldScrollToEndWhenSendingMessage`: Auto-scroll on message send
- `shouldScrollToEndWhenAtBottom`: Auto-scroll when at bottom
- `initialScrollToEndMode`: Controls initial scroll behavior for non-reversed list. Because list is not reversed, you must scroll to the end to see latest messages. Available options:
  - `none`: No automatic scrolling, do nothing
  - `animate`: Smooth scroll to end
  - `jump`: Instant scroll to end (wrong position or UI jumps are expected since Flutter does not know exact size of the list)

üéØ Improvements:
- Improved AI agent scrolling behavior example with message pinned to the top of the viewport
- Unified API between reversed and non-reversed lists
- Added pagination example

## 1.1.0

This release marks a major chat architecture overhaul based on a community feedback. In the future we don't expect such big changes in one release and will try to do backwards compatible code as much as possible.

Breaking changes:

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [FileMessage] `fileName` is renamed to `name`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [ImageMessage] `imageName` is renamed to `name`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [Messages] `authorId` is replaced with `author` to support avatars and names inside the chat
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [Messages] `timestamp` is renamed to `createdAt`. All timestamps are in `ms` now.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [Status] `read` is renamed to `seen`
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: [User] `avatarUrl` is renamed to `imageUrl`
- New `custom` and `unsupported` message types. First one is used to build any message you want, second one is to support backwards compatibility

New features:

- Ability to display user name & avatar, `showUserAvatars` and `showUserNames`
- Automatic messages animation
- Pagination, `onEndReached` (use this function to load more items, should be async to correctly show loading indicator), `onEndReachedThreshold` (value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that loading should start when all previous items are visible and 0.5 indicates half of items are visible, defaults to 0.75), `isLastPage` (if true loading indicator will not be shown)
- `buildCustomMessage` to build anything you want. Can be improved to modify bubble, PRs are open :)
- Time is moved to headers
- Theme with more customizations

Theme migration guide:

- `attachmentButtonIcon`, `deliveredIcon`, `documentIcon`, `errorIcon`, `seenIcon`, `sendButtonIcon` type change `String` -> `Widget`
- `body1` replaced with `emptyChatPlaceholderTextStyle`, `inputTextStyle`, `receivedMessageBodyTextStyle`, `sentMessageBodyTextStyle`
- `body2` replaced with `receivedMessageLinkDescriptionTextStyle`, `sentMessageLinkDescriptionTextStyle`
- `subtitle1` replaced with `receivedMessageLinkTitleTextStyle`, `sentMessageLinkTitleTextStyle`
- `subtitle2` and `subtitle2Color` are replaced with `dateDividerTextStyle`
- `caption` and `captionColor` are replaced with `receivedMessageCaptionTextStyle`, `sentMessageCaptionTextStyle`
