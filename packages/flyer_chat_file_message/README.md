This package provides an opinionated file message widget for use with the [`flutter_chat_ui`](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/packages/flutter_chat_ui) package.

## Purpose

This widget is designed specifically to render file messages within a `flutter_chat_ui` implementation. It relies on models and themes provided by [`flutter_chat_core`](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/packages/flutter_chat_core) and is not intended for standalone use outside the [Flyer Chat](https://flyer.chat) ecosystem.

## Installation

Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` alongside `flutter_chat_ui`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_chat_ui: ^2.0.0
  flyer_chat_file_message: ^2.0.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get`.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_chat_ui/flutter_chat_ui.dart';
import 'package:flyer_chat_file_message/flyer_chat_file_message.dart';

Chat(
    builders: Builders(
        fileMessageBuilder: (context, message, index, {
          required bool isSentByMe,
          MessageGroupStatus? groupStatus,
        }) =>
            FlyerChatFileMessage(message: message, index: index),
    ),
);
```
