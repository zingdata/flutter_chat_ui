This package provides an opinionated image message widget for use with the [`flutter_chat_ui`](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/packages/flutter_chat_ui) package.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Cross-Platform Caching:** Caches images on all platforms (including web) using [`cross_cache`](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/packages/cross_cache).
- ⏳ **Progress Indicators:** Displays built-in indicators for image upload and download progress.
- 🎨 **Loading Placeholders:** Shows Blurhash or Thumbhash placeholders while the full image loads for a better user experience.
- 📐 **Aspect Ratio Preservation:** Maintains correct image dimensions during loading for smoother layout transitions (relies on width/height in the message).
- ➕ **Optional Overlay:** Supports adding an optional overlay (NSFW content, hidden messsage, etc.)

## Purpose

This widget is designed specifically to render image messages within a `flutter_chat_ui` implementation. It relies on models and themes provided by [`flutter_chat_core`](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/tree/main/packages/flutter_chat_core) and is not intended for standalone use outside the [Flyer Chat](https://flyer.chat) ecosystem.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_chat_ui: ^2.0.0
  flyer_chat_image_message: ^2.0.0

Then run `flutter pub get`.
